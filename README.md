# KYA323: Atomic physics

Welcome to the code repository for computational content associated with the atomic physics component of [KYA323: Atomic and Nuclear Physics](https://www.utas.edu.au/courses/cse/units/kya323-atomic-and-nuclear-physics) at the [University of Tasmania](https://www.utas.edu.au/). This site is not intended to be a learning hub ([the course website](https://atomic.utasphys.cloud.edu.au/) serves that purpose) but rather is a convenient place to store and access code, which in most cases throughout the course, will be executed using our cloud-based jupyter server.

For any educators that may have stumbled across this site, I can thoroughly recommend the usage of [nbgitpuller](https://nbgitpuller.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) as a convenient way for distributing code to a class.
